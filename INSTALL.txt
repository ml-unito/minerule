MINERULE INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------------------

1. Get the sources:
   git clone ssh://mluser@kdd.di.unito.it/usr/local/GIT/minerule
2. cd into the directory created by git
   cd minerule
3. install dependencies
   install cmake
   cd into ExtLibs where you will find as snapshot of the libraries needed by minerule.
	  - unzip, build, and install libodbc++. if you are installing on OS X, you may consider
	  		to install the library using homebrew through the command:
				brew install https://raw.github.com/boborbt/homebrew/libodbc++/Library/Formula/libodbc++.rb		)
      - unzip, build, and install galib245 (be sure to verify that the include files in /usr/local/include/ga have read permissions for your user)
      - unzip libgist (there is no need to install it since only few headers are needed)
4. build the system
   create a build directory just below the minerule directory
      mkdir build
   configure and make the project from within this directory
      cd build
      cmake ../src
      make
5. enjoy!

After step 4, if everything is fine, you will find the minerule executables in the directory 'build'.
You still have to configure your odbc datasources, create an option file for the minerule and configure the database you will use to support the system (see directory Docs for more information).
